How to Use

To use this project, simply download the code and open the index.html file in your web browser. The user list and search box should appear automatically.

To filter the list of users, simply start typing in the search box. The list will automatically update to show only the users whose names contain the search term.

Customization

You can customize the user list by editing the JavaScript file (script.js). The file includes an array of user objects, each with a name and age property. You can modify this array to include your own list of users.

Credits

This project was inspired by the Search User List codepen by Florin Pop. The code has been modified and extended to create a live filtering experience.
